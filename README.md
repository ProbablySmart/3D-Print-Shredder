# 3D-Print-Shredder
Modified paper shredder


DANGER! Please Do Not Do this at Home! If you do, do it at your own risk, the 3D printed electrical box 
is not ER Rated and does not provide proper insulation/protection from electrical hazards, 
in addition be careful when handling/operating the shredder. 
Avoid sticking your hand around the shredder teeth, possible laceration as well as mutilation can occur.
Please don't fuck around with electricity!
